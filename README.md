# Pharma POS
Pharma POS is a point of sale application for Romanian-market pharmacies, which will include features like:

- Nomenclature management (catalogs for products, clients, suppliers, national Rx drugs, etc.)
- Streamlined point of sale functionality for both overt-the-counter (OTC) products and highly regulated prescription drugs (Rx), interfacing with all required national and international (EU) health insurance and health regulation services (SIUI, SIPE, CEAS, OSMR, SNVM, etc.)
- Automatic importing of regulation catalogs and issueing rules for Rx drugs.
- 1D and 2D Barcode reader support for scanning prescriptions and products.
- Smart-card reader support for health insurance cards and digital signing.
- 100% stock traceability with support for printing your own custom adhesive labels with 1D and 2D barcodes.
- and more, through a product-focused dedication to constant improvement and listening to feedback.

The application is currently being developed by one engineer with a decade of experience working in the Romanian pharmacy industry (me) and it is based on modern web technologies (Next.js, React.js, Node.js, etc.) and Microsoft .NET (for interfacing with external client hardware). The application is built with the intent to be deployed in the cloud and focuses on a modular and functional architecture.
